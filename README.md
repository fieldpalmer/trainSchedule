# trainSchedule

This project uses jQuery and Moment.js to display a dynamic and informative train schedule (with fictional trains) with a few interesting features:
*  Display minutes 'til arrival
* Add new trains
* Update next arrivals and minutes away on the fly

The train schedule is useful for not only keeping track of recurring events, but also for getting comfortable with the basics of moment.js and continuing education on using JavaScript & jQuery

How users can get started with the project
* Schedulers: Add a train and wait for it to show up! Don't get your hopes to high for the countdown, though. 
* Developers: Download the code and play with it. Change the headings, calculations, add things go crazy!
